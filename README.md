# Traveling-Sales-Person
## Project Description

We will take a look at the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The input to the problem is a list of cities we must visit together with perfect information about the distance between any two cities. Our goal is to choose any starting city, visit every other city exactly once, and return to the starting city in such a way that the total travel distance is minimized.

Your group will implement three algorithms to address TSP: a greedy selection algorithm, an evolutionary mutation algorithm, and an exhaustive backtracking algorithm. Some design requirements and considerations for each algorithm are presented below. Before writing any code, your group must collectively write a pseudocode description of each algorithm and discuss it with the instructor.
