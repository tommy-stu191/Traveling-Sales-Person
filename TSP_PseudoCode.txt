HELPER FUNCTIONS
    count_distance

Greedy
    have a starting city
    make a tour list
    initialize total_distance and lowest_distance
    current city is last item of tour list
    ??lowest distance = 13001?

    list of distances is the value in the main dictionary represented by
    the current city

    while there are cities that have not been seen
        for distance in current city distance list
            if distance is in tour list
                none
            elif distance not in tour list
                new_distance

            if new distance less than lowest distance
                lowest distance is the new distance
                add lowest distance to total distance
